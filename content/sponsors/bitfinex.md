[Bitfinex](https://bitfinex.com) was one of the first cryptocurrency exchanges, founded in 2012 to deliver the finest trading experience for retail, professional and institutional customers.

Our focus has always been on providing the best standards of security and high throughput in a safe and low latency environment so that traders can access our highly liquid markets. 

Over the last decade, Bitfinex has worked relentlessly to educate customers about the benefits and attributes of Bitcoin and the blockchain while providing a technically superior environment to buy, hold and sell tokens.

Our leading-edge solutions, services, and knowledge have been the foundation of our success and allowed us to execute on a bigger, more comprehensive global vision that enables us to further the true principles of Bitcoin: equality, justice, and freedom.

We strongly believe that mass acceptance of crypto is most likely to occur because of its permissionless features and its ability to create a more open and equitable world.

Bitfinex was born at the dawn of the Bitcoin revolution, and everything we do is focused on creating simple, dependable, and accessible technology that promotes freedom.

In November 2022, Bitfinex launched its [Freedom Manifesto](https://blog.bitfinex.com/announcements/the-bitfinex-freedom-manifesto/), a public statement of our guiding principles and our strategy to deliver our vision of being the leading global advocate for freedom by accelerating a transition to a more open and fair world.

We chose El Salvador to launch our manifesto as the worldâ€™s first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.

We invite everyone to read it, comment on it and support it.

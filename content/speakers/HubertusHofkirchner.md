Hubertus Hofkirchner conceived and founded Bitcredit Protocol, a community-driven open software project which aims to facilitate the adoption of Bitcoin by the real economy. Bitcredit is a fiat-less on-ramp and circular Bitcoin system based on an elastic Bitcoin money supply to finance working capital needs and the wage fund for workers. A former commercial banker, investment banker, and telecom CEO, Hubertus has been an independent serial entrepreneur at the intersection of finance and IT for two decades, founding an online brokerage, a digital options exchange, and a global prediction market platform. He also hosts the monthly Austrian Economics Salon at Vienna's Hayek Institute. 
On the political front, Hubertus co-founded the radically decentralised Not-A-Party project GILT 2.0 aiming to change the party system into a statistically-representative democracy. GILT got 1% of votes at its first national election in Austria and will give it another try once Bitcredit stands on its own feet.

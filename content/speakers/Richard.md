Richard, a former Aerospace Engineer is now focused full-time working in the freedom technology space. His love for running and bitcoin drove him to found Bitcoin Runners: A running club for likeminded individuals to take part in social runs, races, and other events representing bitcoin and fitness around the world. This connection led him to help establish the Running Bitcoin Challenge alongside pioneering bitcoin enthusiasts. With Fran Finney as the Honorary Chair, this initiative aims to fundraise for ALSA Gold West Chapter in honour of legendary cypherpunk Hal Finney. Richardâ€™s desire to accelerate the adoption of bitcoin led him to co-found Lightning Piggy, an electronic cash piggy bank for children to accept bitcoin over lightning. Outside of these and other bitcoin ventures, Richard can be found either running or coaching fellow runners in the south of England.

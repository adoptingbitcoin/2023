Paolo Ardoino serves as the Chief Technology Officer of Tether and Bitfinex.

Paolo became fascinated with coding when he was 8 years old and ever since, his favourite thing to do has been experimenting with how new technologies can be harnessed to solve some of the world's most pressing problems.

His curiosity has led him to become a versatile builder with a profound understanding of programming languages and technologies, algorithms and its applications across diverse domains, parallel and distributed computing and trading systems.

Paolo seemed destined to fill this role from his earliest interaction with computers, quickly becoming obsessed with hardware, networks, and cryptography. After his graduation from Genoa's Computer Science University in 2008, Paolo started working as a researcher for a military project focused on high availability, self-recovering networks, and cryptography. Throughout this role, Paolo refined his knowledge of distributed systems and experimented extensively with cryptography.

Interested in finance, Paolo began developing financial related applications in 2010 and founded his first startup as CTO in late 2013. Backed by two financing investment rounds, his company developed a comprehensive, cloud-based financial application for advisors, fund managers & institutions, and served numerous small and medium sized companies throughout London, Milan and Lugano.

Paolo eventually joined Bitfinex, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, as Senior Software Developer in 2014, tasked with trading engine development, platform scalability and high-availability. Later in 2016, Paolo transitioned to the role of Chief Technology Officer. Specifically, at Bitfinex, Paolo leads the development of the Bitfinex platform, and ensures its ability to withstand all market conditions, so that we can meet the needs of our customers day and night. His role encompasses the management of Bitfinex's technology development team, the evaluation of cutting-edge technologies and the design and development of our backend infrastructure, to ensure scalability, high availability, fault tolerance, and high performance.

Paolo also assumed the role of Chief Technology Officer for Tether in 2017, the leading stablecoin and communications company. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency, pegged to the price of a national currency or a commodity.
As the CTO of Tether, Paolo is responsible for overseeing the development and dissemination of technology for external customers, vendors, and other clients to help improve and increase business.

Specifically, at Tether, he currently leads the development and security teams for the company behind the world's largest stablecoin, USDt, which currently has ~83 billion dollars in assets under management (May 2023), and Tether's other stablecoin products such as Tether Gold XAUt, which is a stablecoin pegged to physical gold. With Tether's stablecoin products being mainly blockchain and cryptography based, a key part of Paolo's role is to ensure the quality, security, stability, and robustness of the different integrations and solutions, which are currently available across 14 different blockchains.

In addition to its technical responsibilities, he co-leads the strategy for Tether, focusing on global expansion, investments, and creating new business lines. One of my most exciting projects has been co-founding Holepunch, a peer-to-peer, fully encrypted, unstoppable communication layer that has developed open-source libraries and components for building applications without any centralised infrastructure or point of failure. Holepunch's first product, Keet, is a P2P text, voice, and video chat. As the public face of Tether, Paolo is proud to be a part of an innovative and forward-thinking team that is shaping the future of finance and communication.

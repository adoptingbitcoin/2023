Husband and wife team, Deanna Heikkinen and Joel Marquez are long-time Bitcoiners and homeschool advocates. Deanna, a former college professor turned homeschool teacher, has a background in educational policy history, curriculum design, and teaching students writing, reading, history, and humanities from second grade through college. Joel's background as a writer and working in technology brings storytelling and a deep understanding of Bitcoin to the team. Together, they founded a curriculum company teaching an integrated approach to the Great Books for homeschool families. Most recently, they moved to El Salvador and are setting up a new homeschool enrichment tutoring company, Lyceum Tutoring. They also work to advocate for Bitcoiners around the world to merge the idea of financial sovereignty with their child's education.

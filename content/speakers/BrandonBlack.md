Brandon has been peripherally interested in bitcoin for a long time, and working full time as a bitcoin wallet engineer for over 5 years. He works in bitcoin because it's the most impactful thing he can do to make the world his children inherit better than the one we live in. As a result, his focus is on sovereign bitcoin custody and financial privacy. He's enthusiastic about Chaumian ecash, Lightning, Ark, and other ways to bring financial sovereignty to more people. It's also OK to have fun along the way, so he likes inscriptions.

Originally from Canada, I left the country over 8 years ago and spent over 6 years living on Bali. I began my Bitcoin journey when I learned firsthand how difficult it is to transact out of country, and after being heavily taxed while moving my life savings out of my home country. After reading the Bitcoin Whitepaper, and The Bitcoin Standard, I knew this was a magical currency but living off Bitcoin in Indonesia was difficult, often meant sitting in a sketchy office in Ubud sending BTC to the guy behind the desk while he monitored the tx on blockchain explorer before handing me an envelope of Rupiah. Seeing ES adopt Bitcoin meant to me that returning to Latin America was the best idea, after which point our team here in Yucatan came together on the mission to initiate a circular economy here.

Ajelex has been actively engaged in Bitcoin education in France with Découvre Bitcoin for several years. Recently, in the summer of 2023, he joined the Cubo+ initiative as a teacher. Choosing to remain in El Salvador, he has continued to work on various initiatives within the country and has taken on a mentorship role for Cubo+ graduates joining the organization. One notable project is Node Nation, where Découvre Bitcoin installs Lightning nodes in high school computer science classes nationwide. This serves as the foundation for Bitcoin education, aiming to inspire the next generation of Cubo+ applicants.

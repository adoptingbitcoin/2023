Rahim Taghizadegan is the last Austrian economist in the direct tradition in Austria and the first one to grasp Bitcoin. He has written more than 15 books (e.g. "Austrian School for Investors") and has been teaching economics at many universities around Europe. He used to be a nuclear physicist and engineer, and is now an investor in Bitcoin citadels.   
At #AB23, Rahim will deliver a historical deep dive on the monetary bonds between Europe and Latin America, contrasting win-lose extraction with win-win pioneering, and drawing lessons for the potential of future economic and cultural development in El Salvador.

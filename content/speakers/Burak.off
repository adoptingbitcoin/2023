Burak started in Bitcoin in 2017, exploring and building around mining, payments, wallets, developer tools and most recently, Bitcoin-style smart contracts. His name became known in the space with the design of Bitmatrix, an automatic market maker and trustless exchange protocol on the Liquid Network, as well as for executing unusal transactions that broke the LND implementation. In 2023, he proposed Ark - a new second layer scaling solution that has the potential of onboarding billions to bitcoin in a self-custodial way.

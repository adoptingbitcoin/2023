Alejandra studied international business at the University of Texas, and later modern psychology and Buddhism at Princeton University. Her third major was acting in Mexico City. Something that fills her with satisfaction is providing assistance to others and participating in the task of promoting their growth and knowledge, which is why she decided to be a Bitcoin ambassador in her country and also promote food independence. She started to be self-sufficient in her food when her father got cancer of the pancreas. That is why one of her life missions is to educate people to be self-sufficient in their economy and food.

I'm 31 years old and I'm from a small village in Bavaria. Through my work as a teacher in different types of public schools I gained a lot of experience about our educational system and why it is the way it is. As a consequence of my experiences I left the public school system and now I'm working as the principal of a small Montessorischool in Germany.

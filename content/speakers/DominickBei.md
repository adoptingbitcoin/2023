Dom is a 14 year Firefighter from California with over 10 years as an elected officer of the Firefighters Union. Initially a passive Bitcoin participant and student since 2017, a fateful rescue of a Bitcoin analyst in 2022 started Dom on a new mission: to orange pill unions and worker organizations and assist with long term adoption. Building a model he called "Proof of Workforce" Dom collaborated with the Santa Monica Firefighters who became the first union to collectively self-custody Bitcoin. He now hosts a new show, "The Nakamoto Gauntlet," produced by Swan Bitcoin with co-hosts Raphael Zigury, Greg Foss and Joe Carlasare. Dom has written several Bitcoin articles with his latest article published in Bitcoin Magazine "How Bitcoin can save California's $440 Billion Pension Fund"

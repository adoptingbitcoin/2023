  - question: 'Hotels and Lodging'
    answer: 'Generally we recommend that visitors stay in San Salvador for the first two days of the conference, ideally at the Crowne Plaza itself, since that is where the conference takes place, but there are many hotels and lodging opportunities nearby as well, including good offers on Airbnb. On the third day, there will be a trip to Bitcoin Beach with shuttles, and some attendees prefer to book lodging there or in the nearby town of El Tunco. Others take the shuttle back in the evening to San Salvador (30 mins drive). Most satellite events and evening programs will be taking place in the area around the Crowne and the World Trade Center. '

    answer: 'Most restaurants and bars are starting to offer bitcoin lightning payment options. However, we recommend that you keep a credit card or cash at hand at all times if you need other options.'

    answer: 'Tickets purchased for the conference cannot be reimbursed, but it is possible to transfer tickets to another person. If you pass on your ticket, please <a href=mailto:info@adoptingbitcoin.org>drop us an email</a> so we can adjust the name on the conference badge.'
